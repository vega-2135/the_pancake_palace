## 2. Agile Development

The project development at The Pancake Palace was guided by Agile principles, allowing iterative and incremental enhancements to the projects's design throughout its evolution. leveraging GitHub's robust features to implement Scrum methodology effectively.GitHub Issues served as the backbone of the product backlog, housing detailed user stories. GitHub Issues' tagging feature was used to assign story points, prioritize features using the MoSCoW method, and categorize user stories for streamlined development. Additionally, GitHub's Milestones feature aided in sprint planning and deadline setting, ensuring timely delivery of project milestones.

Utilizing GitHub Issues and Projects, I meticulously managed each aspect of my project, organizing them into Epics and further breaking them down into User Stories with associated Tasks. Epics represented significant features, while User Stories were prioritized as mentioned using the MoSCoW technique, ensuring efficient allocation of resources.

GitHub's Project board provided a visual representation of our progress, utilizing a [kanban board](https://github.com/users/vega-2135/projects/2/views/1) approach to track user story development from 'Todo' to 'Done', with each stage signifying the completion of specific development milestones.


Furthermore, GitHub milestones were employed to group related user stories, enhancing project organization and cohesion which additionally aided in sprint planning and deadline setting, ensuring timely delivery of project milestones.

- ### Design

- #### Structure
The Recipe Book app boasts a straightforward layout, prioritizing user-friendliness and seamless navigation. Its uniform page structure ensures users can effortlessly locate desired information. With a responsive design, the app adapts seamlessly across various devices, guaranteeing clear visibility. All pages show a navigation menu that offers users a consistent means to explore the site's content. Employing CSS and Bootstrap rows and columns, the app maintains a tidy and cohesive content arrangement throughout its pages.


- #### Colour Scheme

The color Light Purple (rgb(171, 196, 255)) was chosen as the background color for the website header and footer, as well as for the listing of ingredients, preparation steps, and borders of card containers.

The color white was chosen as the background color of the website.

The color black was chosen as the font color for all text on the website, as it provides the best contrast with the white background of the website.

- #### Typography

In crafting the typography for our website, deliberate consideration was given to ensure optimal readability and aesthetic appeal. To achieve this balance, we've selected the versatile and modern Roboto font as the primary typeface throughout the entire site. Renowned for its clean lines, readability, and versatility across various screen sizes and resolutions, Roboto offers a seamless reading experience. Its uniformity and clarity elevate the presentation of content, ensuring that users can effortlessly engage with our platform's offerings. By employing Roboto consistently across all text elements, from headers to paragraphs, I aim to deliver a cohesive and visually pleasing browsing experience to users.
