## 2. Agile Development

The project development at The Pancake Palace was guided by Agile principles, allowing iterative and incremental enhancements to the projects's design throughout its evolution. leveraging GitHub's robust features to implement Scrum methodology effectively.GitHub Issues served as the backbone of the product backlog, housing detailed user stories. GitHub Issues' tagging feature was used to assign story points, prioritize features using the MoSCoW method, and categorize user stories for streamlined development. Additionally, GitHub's Milestones feature aided in sprint planning and deadline setting, ensuring timely delivery of project milestones.

Utilizing GitHub Issues and Projects, I meticulously managed each aspect of my project, organizing them into Epics and further breaking them down into User Stories with associated Tasks. Epics represented significant features, while User Stories were prioritized as mentioned using the MoSCoW technique, ensuring efficient allocation of resources.

GitHub's Project board provided a visual representation of our progress, utilizing a [kanban board](https://github.com/users/vega-2135/projects/2/views/1) approach to track user story development from 'Todo' to 'Done', with each stage signifying the completion of specific development milestones.


Furthermore, GitHub milestones were employed to group related user stories, enhancing project organization and cohesion which additionally aided in sprint planning and deadline setting, ensuring timely delivery of project milestones.
